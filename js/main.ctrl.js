I was tasked with writing queries which categorized each member into a section depending on their job title.  Furthermore I added another query to breaks team member into multiple pages depending where they are stationed. To add a more modern touch I added alternate images which appear when the user hovers over a team member.  Once the user clicks the image of the team member the information for that particular person is pulled in via AJAX and populates a div below them.  To avoid long load times all of the images are lazy loaded to the page. Everything is dynamic. This mean Cornerstone Autism Center can add or remove as many team members without me having to change any code. An example of the categorized sub pages is shown below."

Inside my child theme I used Sass, JavaScript, and Jquery to finish this project. I used Contact 7 forms to complete the contact forms and Custom Fields to allow customization for the client. I altered the Contact forms using hooks to CC a particular owner if certain parameters were meet when a contact form was submitted. I used Custom Fields to allow the client to be able to alter any image or background, alter captions, and titles to his liking in the future. I refrained from using any other plugins to avoid issues which could arise from deprecated code.'
