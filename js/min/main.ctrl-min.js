This company has multiple locations.  I was tasked with writing queries which categorized each member into a section depending on their job title.  Furthermore I added another query to breaks team member into multiple pages depending where they are stationed. To add a more modern touch I added alternate images which appear when the user hovers over a team member.  Once the user clicks the image of the team member the information for that particular person is pulled in via AJAX and populates a div below them.  To avoid long load times all of the images are lazy loaded to the page. Everything is dynamic. This mean Cornerstone Autism Center can add or remove as many team members without me having to change any code. An example of the categorized sub pages is shown below."},{id:2,title:"Weatherbee Talent Group",link:"http://weatherbeetalent.com/",preview:"../assets/weatherbee.png",image:"../assets/weatherbee-clip.jpg",alt:"Weatherbee Snapshot",content:"Weatherbee Talent Group is a talent agency based in California. I was tasked with the job of integrating the designs for this website into Wordpress.  This client wanted to use a Wordpress theme, but wanted it be highly altered to meet his wants.  In order to achieve this task I created child theme.  Inside my child theme I used Sass, JavaScript, and Jquery to finish this project. I used Contact 7 forms to complete the contact forms and Custom Fields to allow customization for the client. I altered the Contact forms using hooks to CC a particular owner if certain parameters were meet when a contact form was submitted. I used Custom Fields to allow the client to be able to alter any image or background, alter captions, and titles to his liking in the future. I refrained from using any other plugins to avoid issues which could arise from deprecated code."},{id:3,title:"Restaurant Review",link:"http://rafaelheard.com/new-eats/",preview:"../assets/rest.png",image:"../assets/review-clip.jpg",alt:"Restaurant Review Snapshot",content:"This website is something I built in my free time. I designed this from start to finish using Photoshop. I've noticed a few restaurant websites recently geared more so for a mobile experience, so I started my designs from mobile and worked my way up to desktop. Once I was done designing I began the development phase.  I used Sass and Jquery to finish this website. I used flexbox throughout this website to showcase my understanding of this aspect."},{id:4,title:"Ordering app",link:"",preview:"../assets/menu.jpg",image:"../assets/orderingApp.png",alt:"Preview of App","class":"no-shadow",content:"This is a application I built in my free time.  The premise is a user would order food using their mobile device from a single restaurant or multiple locations. Once all desired items have been added to the cart they are able to checkout, and they will be able to see a quick recap of what they ordered.  With the idea it would be mainly used on mobile devices.  I designed and developed this application mobile up. I used Photoshop to create wireframes and mockups.  Angular, jQuery, HTML, and SASS helps my application function properly."}];var a="contact-form-handler.php";t.codeStatus="",t.form={},t.submit=function(i){return console.log($.param(t.form)),e({method:"POST",url:a,data:$.param(t.form),headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}}).success(function(e){console.log(e)}).error(function(e){console.log("not sent")}),!1}}]);
